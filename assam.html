                        <h3>Kaziranga National Park</h3>
                        <p>Kaziranga National Park lies partly in Golaghat District and partly in Nagaon District of Assam. It is the oldest park in assam covers an area of 430 Sq kms along the river Brahmaputra on the North and the Karbi Anglong hills on the South. The National Highway 37 passes through the park area and tea estates, hemmed by table-top tea bushes. One can even see the rhinos and wild elephants straying near the highway.</p>

                        <p>Kaziranga National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has the world's highest population of the Great Indian one horned rhinoceros and a good number of royal bengal tigers along with many other wild animals like different species of deer, wild elephants, leopards, bear, wild boar and the list goes on. Kaziranga National Park is also a haven for migratory birds during the winter season and is an ideal place for birders and wildlife photographers. The landscape of Kaziranga is of sheer forest, tall elephant grass, rugged reeds, marshes & shallow pools. It has been declared as a National Park in 1974.
                        The park is open from November to April. Tourists can take rides on elephants or opt for jeep safari to explore the different ranges of the park.
                        Winter temperature in Kaziranga can vary between 8°c to 25°c while summers can be quite hot and humid with temperatures ranging from 28°c to 36°c. During the monsoons, the park is flooded by the Brahmaputra river which results in the death of many animals.
                        Kaziranga National Park has 4 ranges that tourists can explore. They are, Central Range in Kohora, Western Range in Bagori, Eastern Range in Agaratoli and Burapahar Range at Ghorakhati</p>

                        <p>To enjoy the best of the park, it would be good to take a jeep or elephant but what apart from these options? Fortunately around Kaziranga, one can find an ample number of nature getaway options like wildlife sanctuaries, parks for bird watching and hill stations. So, if, by chance, tourists have some extra days at their disposal than go to the list of places mentioned below to make the holiday even memorable. Below are some places to visit around Kaziranga National Park:
                        Nameri National Park (60 kms), Hoollongapar Gibbon Sanctuary, Addabarie Tea Estate, Kakochang waterfall (46 kms), Deopahar (51 kms)

                        <h3>Manas National Park</h3>
                        <p>Manas National Park is located in the State of Assam in North-East India, a biodiversity hotspot. Covering an area of 500 sq kilometres, it spans the Manas river and is bounded to the north by the forests of Bhutan and is contiguous with the Royal Manas National Park in Bhutan. Manas National Park is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a project tiger reserve. The park's scenic beauty includes a range of forested hills, alluvial grasslands and tropical evergreen forests. Manas National Park provides critical and viable habitats for rare and endangered species, including tigers and the greater one-horned rhino. The wild buffalo population is probably the only pure strain of this species still found in India. It also harbours endemic species like pygmy hog, hispid hare and golden langur as well as the endangered Bengal florican. Manas has exceptional importance within the Indian sub-continent’s protected areas, as one of the most significant remaining natural areas in the region, where sizeable populations of a large number of threatened species continue to survive.</p>

                        <p>Manas is recognized not only for its rich biodiversity but also for its spectacular scenery and natural landscape.</p>

                        <p>So try to include Manas on your next trip to Northeast India and if you are a birder, photographer or simply a wildlife enthusiast like me then you should definitely visit this piece of natural wonder.</p>

                        <h3>Nameri National Park and Tiger Reserve</h3>
                        <p>Nameri National Park and Tiger Reserve is located in Sonitpur district of Assam and shares its northern boundary with the Pakhui Wildlife Sanctuary of Arunachal Pradesh. The nearest town is Tezpur which is a mere 20 minutes drive from Nameri. Nameri has a total area of 200 square kilometres (120 square miles). Nameri National Park was declared as Tiger Reserve in the year 1999-2000, and is the second Tiger reserve of Assam after Manas Tiger Reserve. The river Jia-Bhoroli is the lifeline of Nameri, which flows along the southern boundary of the park from northwest to southeast. In the east, the river Bor-Dikorai is a tributary of river Jia-Bhoroli, flowing along the southern boundary from northeast to southwest.</p>

                        <p>Nameri National Park is arguably the most scenic of all national parks in Assam. It is a paradise for birders and it is teeming with bio diversity. Nameri National Park overlooks the Eastern Himalayas in the background and has the lively Jia Bhoroli river criss-crossing the national park. Historically popular with anglers, today, Nameri is popular with wildlife researchers and enthusiasts.</p>

                        <p>It is home to over 600 floral species including rudrakhsa and rare orchids. Close to 400 bird species have been recorded here including the Great Pied Hornbill, white winged wood duck, rufus necked hornbill, black stork, ibis bill and more. And in terms of mammals, Nameri national park provides habitat for Asian elephant, royal bengal tigers, leopards, clouded leopard, marbled cat, gaur, barking deer, dhole, Himalayan black bear, capped langur, Malayan giant squirrel, wild boar, slow loris and many more. It is also home to a wide range of reptiles, amphibians and fishes.</p>

                        <p>But, unlike other national parks, there are no jeep safaris here. Instead, you explore the forest on foot, on top of an elephant or by bicycle. And all of these in the company of an armed forest guard in case you happen to come real close to a wild animal. It is this slow exploration in the wild that makes Nameri so special. If you are patient and quiet, you will become one with the jungle in a matter of an hour and you will get to see wild animals in close proximity and that too without bothering them. And when you feel like you need a break from the steamy jungles, you can head to the Jia-Bhoroli river, get on a raft, feel the wind on your face and see the jungle from a whole new perspective.</p>

                        <p>If you are a student of nature or a wildlife enthusiast, you will really appreciate Assam’s wildlife haven. I would recommend Nameri National Park to one and all in a heart beat. That is how rich and bio diverse it is! The best time to visit Nameri National park would be between November and March. Summers can be quite warm and humid and the national park receives plentiful rains during the monsoon season. Winter months are best for photography and perfect for long walks. If you are a thrill seeker then you can get that rush of adrenaline by going for hard water rafting in the turbulent waters of Jia Bhoroli during monsoons.</p>

                        <h3>Majuli</h3>
                        <p>Majuli, encircled by the rushing waters of the Brahmaputra river, is a 352 square kilometre island district in the Northeast Indian state of Assam. Famous for it's Satras and slowly gaining popularity worldwide, the island witnesses a decent number of tourists from all over the world.</p>

                        <p>Ferries are the only choice for reaching the island, and they only run during daylight hours. A bridge is currently under construction and once finished, will provide much needed respite to residents of the island. But for tourists ferries are a better choice as the hour long ride to reach Majuli from Jorhat gives you a chance to admire the vastness of the majestic Brahmaputra river and the scenic views it provides.</p>

                        <p>The variable nature of the land makes life difficult for much of Majuli’s population. The majority of the island’s inhabitants are dependent on agriculture to survive, and as the years pass, the amount of destruction and loss of land from flash floods and erosion is straining their ability to adapt and provide for themselves.Most affected by natural disasters are those living closest to the Brahmaputra’s banks, and the damage is not restricted to farmers alone. The Kumar people in southeastern Majuli are one such example; they make a living handcrafting pots from river clay. The nature of their materials dictates they remain close to the river’s edge. The need to load wares onto boats to trade throughout Assam cements the decision. Others on Majuli island, such as the Mishing tribe, have adapted to the surging waters over time. Their homes and infrastructure are propped up on spindly bamboo stilts, placing them just above the floodwater levels during monsoon. Tourism is the island’s most promising solution, and it’s already catching on. Majuli’s green fields and flat roads are the perfect playgrounds for tourists looking to enjoy its nature and culture from atop a bike or scooter. Domestic tourists comprise the majority of the island’s visitors, though a trickle of foreign tourists find their way to the island hidden away in India’s northeast. The island’s handful of historic satras, monasteries dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu, draw yet more spiritual tourists. Each satra is a place of study and prayer for the residing monks, as well as a center for performing arts. Visitors to the satras can chat over tea with the monks, watch men clad in handmade masks perform ancient epics in the form of plays known as Bhaona in Assamese, or even spend a night in one of the satra’s adjoining guesthouses. The first satra was built on Majuli in the 15th century, and 64 more followed in its footsteps. Today, however, only 22 satras remain on the island. The others were washed away, and eventually rebuilt in locations on Assam’s mainland less at risk from erosion.</p>

                        <p>So what is there to do in Majuli island that attracts tourists? There are the above-mentioned satras, of course, most of which can be visited. At some of the satras, monks give traditional performances involving dance and drumming. Majuli is also famed for its mask making. Elaborate masks depicting various gods are painstakingly made by hand, and many of the masks you might encounter are used for theatre performances. To see the mask-making process, head over to Natun Samaguri Satra, where Mr. Goswami will happily show you around and perform using several of his masks.</p>

                        <p>Don't miss out on the ethnic rice beer. You can find rice beer all over the northeast, and Majuli is no exception. This homemade concoction is delicious and cheap, and one of the best ways to befriend the locals is to hang out with for a night of drinking and chatting.Visit local craftsmen and women. Throughout the island, you can find craftsmen and women making all sorts of handicrafts. From the pottery mentioned above to beautiful woven saris and even boats. If you like handicrafts, Majuli island is a perfect place to visit. Majuli island is perfect for cycling. The slow pace of life and relatively empty roads, the lush countryside, the waterways, and the wildlife you might encounter make Majuli a great spot to great spot to grab a bike and explore to your heart’s content.</p>

                        <h3>Sohra</h3>
                        <p>Sohra, popularly known as Cherrapunjee, is located in the East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya, around 35 kms from the capital Shillong. Sohra has stories hidden all over – in its rivers, cascades, and mist-shrouded hill-tops. It is also the place where civilizations meet, the cultural capital of the Khasis and the gateway of the colonial age. The terrain comes alive during the monsoons while the drier months are all about blue skies and scenic hikes and treks. The region around Sohra is synonymous with waterfalls – the plunging Nohkalikai and the thunderous Dainthlen are settings for immortal Khasi folktales while the three-tiered Wei Saw Dong is tucked away in a verdant forest. Sohra provides layers of sights and adventures – the more time you spend here, the more surprises you will encounter.</p>

                        <p>No matter how many times you visit, sohra never ceases to amaze you and leave you spellbound everytime. You have a wide range of stay options in Sohra, from the luxurious Jiva and Polo Orchid resorts to cosy homestays that allow you to soak in the local vibes. Destinations around Sohra include Nongriat and Khat-ar-shnong.</p>

                        <h3>Jowai</h3>
                        <p>Located in the Jaintia Hills district, at a distance of 66 Kms from Shillong, Jowai is famous for its bucolic setting and breathtaking views with the perfect mix of heritage and culture. Jowai, much like Cherrapunjee prides itself of being a destination much loved for a scenic drive and boasting of lakes, vast open valleys and waterfalls. Festivals such as Behdeinkhlam, Chad Sukra and Laho Dance attract many tourists from across India each year.</p>

                        <p>As more travellers explore the eastern sections of Meghalaya, they are discovering the rich culture and previously undocumented landscapes of the Jaintia Hills. Jowai town is a cultural and commercial pivot of this region and its history goes back to the times when the Pnar kings were the dominant force in the region. Jowai provides a starting point for those who want to spend time understanding the local culture and visiting the myriad attractions.</p>

                        <p>Nearby Syntu Ksiar which is located at the basin of the winding Myntdu River is an important historical spot. It has a monument dedicated to the most famous Jaintia freedom fighter – Kiang Nong Bah. The Jowai Presbyterian Church was built in the nineteenth century and is the main architectural highlight of this town. Nearby attractions include Thadlaskein Lake, Tyrshi Falls, Lalong Park and Sacred Grove, and the famous Nartiang monoliths. Enthusiastic non-vegetarians can try the variety of meat dishes of local fish and pork. Jadoh and Doh Khleh are two famous pork dishes which we recommend. For those who are little on the adventurous side, a pungent dish of fermented beans known as Tungtoh is offered here. Jowai has many lodges and guesthouses – the most prominent hotels are found in the town’s entry road near Thadlaskein Lake.</p>

                        <h3>Mawphanlur</h3>
                        <p>Mawphanlur is located in the Khasi Hills region of Meghalaya, slightly off from Shillong-Nongstoin-Tura Highway. It is situated in the West Khasi Hills District. The nearest noticeable village is Markasa (about 70 kms from Shillong). Markasa lies on Shillong-Nongstoin-Tura Highway and Mawphanlur is just 5 kms away from the highway junction.</p>

                        <p>Picturesque high-altitude meadows sprinkled with small lakes and cottages – that is one way to describe Mawphanlur. An overnight trip is recommended so you can enjoy the starlit skies and cool temperatures that come with the night time. The biggest visual attraction of Mawphanlur is the verdant scenery that would make a romantic poet gush. Think of chirping birds, the occasional wandering calf with a bell, and friendly canines frolicking on the grass. Your Mawphanlur journey can be an activity-filled trip. Kayaking facilities are available on some of the lakes while there are many large boulders around the place where you can try some of your climbing (and stumbling) skills. If you are a photography fanatic then the landscapes provide a great stage for some natural portraits.</p>

                        <h3>Dawki</h3>
                        <p>Dawki, around 80 kms from Shillong, is a border town in the West Jaintia Hills District of Meghalaya and a great base to explore nearby Shnongpdeng and Darrang – famous riverside camps. You will witness a blend of cultures and changing topography as the hills merge into the plains of Northern Bangladesh. Some of the evening scenery here is stunning as you watch the lights glow above the neighbouring plains over the gentle, dark river.</p>

                        <p>Shnongpdeng Village is 8 kms north of Dawki along the winding Umngot river. The water of the Umngot river is so clear, you can peer into the bottom and count the stones – that is how the Umngot River can be described during the peak pre-monsoon, autumn, and winter seasons. But during the rainy season the river inflates and the water turns murky. So it's advisable to visit Dawki between late october to early April. Whether you want to enjoy a gentle boat ride through a stretch flanked by forests or you want to take a dip into the river in scuba gear, the activities in Shnongpdeng will keep you occupied for days. Camping, swimming, and fishing are some of the fun outdoor activities in Shnongpdeng. You can indulge in one of the most thrilling ziplines and rappel down one of the many striking rock formations that line up the Umngot river.</p>

                        <p>A bridge that spans the Umngot river allows for fantastic pictures and perspectives and there are picnic spots near the river. There are plenty of recognized resorts and camps in Dawki, Shnongpdeng, and surrounding areas. Ensure that all your water activities are done with expert supervision and necessary safety gear.</p>

                        <h3>Mawlynnong</h3>
                        <p>Mawlynnong is a village located in the East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya at a distance of around 60 kms from Shillong. It falls on the Shillong-Dawki road and has earned a reputation for being one of the cleanest villages in Asia, but a sobriquet that does more justice is that of God’s Own Garden. The fruit orchards, the rushing streams, the evergreen surroundings, the swaying palms, and the well-preserved traditions of the Khasis provide a picture-perfect stage on the edge of Meghalaya’s southern ranges.</p>

                        <p>Arguably the most famous icon of Meghalaya is found here – the Nohwet Living Root Bridge. The bridge was created by weaving the roots of the Ficus Elastica tree around a framework and continuing this process for generations. These living root bridges are a staple of Khasi traditional architecture and were important for the villages in the steep valleys and mountains, helping the people connect with each other and travel to the plains to trade. These fascinating bridges are built in harmony with nature and get stronger as they grow older. After admiring the bridge, you can also take a dip in the gushing, cool waters of the river. The living root bridge of Nohwet is not the only attraction here. The Church of the Epiphany in Mawlynnong is more than a century old, a beautiful piece of European architecture tucked in the middle of this lush and verdant tropical paradise. Taste your fear of heights and climb up the tree houses close to the church. From these bamboo structures, you can gaze at the seemingly endless plains of Bangladesh that lay just beyond. The cleanest village in India, Mawlynnong Village is also known as God’s Own Garden and for all the right reasons. In 2003, Mawlynnong was awarded the title of the cleanest Village in Asia by Discover India. Alongside cleanliness, the village have achieved a lot- be it 100 percent literacy rate, or a women empowerment scenario that the rest of the world can only dream of. Don't miss out on a visit to this cute little khasi village whenever you are in Meghalaya.</p>

                    <div class="text-container">
                        <h3>Umiam Lake</h3>
                        <p>Umiam, a tranquil lake at the entrance of Shillong town, a place for watery adventures and relaxing boat rides, a treasure for bird watchers and those who enjoy dramatic scenery. Flanked by hills on all sides and lined by striking roadways and bridges, the gentle Umiam Lake is one of the reasons why the Guwahati-Shillong route is considered one of the most scenic in the region. The lake was formed when a dam was built over the Umiam River in the early sixties as part of a hydel power project. Umiam Lake has become a favourite spot for many who come to admire the landscape.</p>

                        <p>The adjoining Orchid Lake Resort is a government-run facility where you can book lodges or grab a bite at the restaurant with fine views. The resort swimming pool, with its dramatic location on the edge of the hill overlooking the lake, is also open to visitors. Umiam Lake is Shillong’s major hub for water sports and boating. Paddle boats, water scooters, and speed boats are some of the plentiful options for those who look to hit the waters. There are many other resorts tucked in the serene lakeside woods where you can spend time amidst the quiet, natural surroundings. If you are looking for sensational views, then the Umiam Lake has a plethora of options. There are many vantage points from where you can capture the waters and the hills beyond – either shrouded in mysterious clouds or bathed with bright sunlight, the golden hours here attract shutterbugs from all over.</p>
